1.Python
-----
# it is there is in market almost for 3 decades.
# python is open source(then it has got identity)
# it is object oriented approach.
# you can it as scripting language.
# python is not over rule other lanugage(it is false),
  do u find c or java going out of the market.


Example:-
---------
# i want to show some specification results to my clients very quickly,  
then i can catch my python impression from clients.

# it is economical language


2.Reason for python identity in recent times
------------------------------------------
# it is nearest human language readable.

# python has easy integration with other languages.

3.core-highlights of python
------------------------
# it is object oriented approach.
# it helps encapsulation standard like other languages.
# python can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte code for large
  application
# like other languages python garbage collection.

4.Main features of python
-------------------------
# standardard python common library(while you program you need cross verify based on os(android/windows/mac/linux applications) like 
  what kind of modules i have import along with parameters).

most famous programming languages that exists in the world

 # assembly based
 # modular
 # object oriented 
 # structured
 # functional approach(big data/artificial intelligence)

python is combination of all of above.


Notes:-
-------
 we generally say it is not compiled language.
 sol :- dont think that is in-secured,you write python script embed that into any particular 
	language that can produce you a byte code.
	
	this byte code run on any machine.


How to run python?
-----------------
# interactive interpreter
		command line(windows/linux/or any other system)
	how it is interactive?(one line statement)
	>>> echo "This is my first python output"
	This is my first python output
once you've asked, displaying immediately is called interactive.
	
# Script from command line(integrated collection of instruction)
		we can execute a python script which is with .py extension at command
		line.
		--- control structure(if,loops)
		--- functions

	>>>print ("my first name is: prashanth)

	>>>print ("my middle name is: kumar)

	>>>print ("my last name is: pamula)

	here you get traceback issue


# integrated development environment(larger development)
	with editors/IDE(it provides facilities and features, we will develops.

	print ("my first name is: prashanth)
	print ("my middle name is: kumar)
	print ("my last name is: pamula)
